## 🌐 About Me

I’m a developer from **Seattle, WA**, who loves building things for the web — from experimental apps to full-scale cloud platforms.  
What started as curiosity has become a deep passion for **creating seamless digital experiences** and pushing the limits of what runs in a browser.

- ✨ **Clean Code:** maintainable, scalable, and efficient  
- 🎨 **Design Focus:** UI that balances function and form  
- ⚡ **Performance:** optimized for speed and smooth UX  
- 🧠 **Innovation:** always exploring the next frontier in web tech  

When I’m not coding, I’m experimenting with design trends, contributing to open-source, or connecting with the dev community on Discord.
